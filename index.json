While providing a detailed example of everything I found, this article is not intended to provide a complete response to the coding challenge.",

It has the same features as the Markdown syntax with a few additions in the front-end application. This is a two-application workaround because one handles the posts and stores them as static HTML files and the other application retrieves this information and converts it into what my DevBlog is.",
