    "description": "This article explains the process and findings on creating a List class in JavaScript that can handle infinite length while also being capable of calculating PI using generator functions. It goes over the implementation of key methods like arctan and PI, providing detailed examples and explanations. Although it covers many aspects of the coding challenge, it is not intended as a complete solution to the problem, but rather as a learning resource.",
