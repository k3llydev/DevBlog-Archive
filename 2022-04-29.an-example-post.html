<p>This article was written as an example of how powerful this tool can be. I&#39;m simply writting markdown sytntax and at any point, this will become HTML in my DevBlog.</p><p>I&#39;ve always loved doing these kind of things because they seem a lot fun for me. In my research through this project, I found many JavaScript libraries that helped me a lot in this journey. One of them is <code>marked</code>, which is actually the library I use to transform this syntax into HTML, with a little help from HTML Minify for sure. And also, I had to configure my API to have a quick way of updating this information exactly when I post a new article.</p><p>I&#39;m highly considering adding a webhook to GitHub (that&#39;s where this app is hosted) so whenever I push any change, this is automatically updated. It will be so great to not have to call the enpoint myself everytime a new post is added.</p><p>For now, this are the to dos:</p><ul><li>Connect GitHub webhook to API</li><li>Overall improvements to build process</li><li>An alternative for assets</li></ul><p>And I will surely keep working on this project on my journey through AWS.</p>
