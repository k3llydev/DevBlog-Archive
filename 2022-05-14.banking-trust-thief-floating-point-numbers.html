<p>With the technologic era banking services became pilars of todays humanity not only by providing a new and more reliabe method of handling money, they also offer additional services like loans, insurances, investment services and many others that might vary depending on the bank.</p><p>Like any other company, it&#39;s implicit that having a positive reputation is a must, but in the banking sector this requirement is everything. Unlike other services where you might consider one or other provider based on pricings, prime materials quality, efficiency, etc., in banking services you might consider stability, reliability, safety and similar adjetives that can be englobed as <strong>trust</strong>.</p><p>This means that losing one customer&#39;s trust could mean losing 5 customers. The numbers might not match, but if you understand how reputation is built you will get that the customer that was lost will remain with a negative feedback about the institution which unfortunately means that his family, friends and near people will receive this feedback, making them consider switching to another bank.</p><p>T</p><hr><p>It&#39;s nothing new that JavaScript is considered one of the best programming languages to dive into software development, but as the learning path reduces, complexity increments making it harder to stay in a clean-code and reliable environment.</p><p>The prime suspect, <strong>Dynamic Typing</strong>. After several investigations, we found clear evidence of our suspect behavior:</p><ul><li>Disguises as &quot;flexibility&quot;.</li><li>Produces &quot;<em>incorrect</em>&quot; results when involved in arithmetic operations.</li><li>Top-level stealth, leaves no trace, evidence nor errors on console.</li></ul><p>These scenarios are the most common behavior of the suspect. But before diving into the main topic, lets define some basic concepts that will help us understand JavaScript.</p><hr><h2 id="what-is-a-floating-point-number">What is a &quot;floating-point&quot; number?</h2><p>In computer science, floating-point is a method of &quot;<em>storing</em>&quot; real numbers in computer-based arithmetic to support trade-off between range and precision. Most typical computer systems use the Double Precision <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> standard, but there are some variants:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Common name</th><th>Base</th><th>Significand bits</th><th>Exponent bits</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>binary16</td><td>Half precision</td><td>2</td><td>11</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>binary32</td><td>Single precision</td><td>2</td><td>24</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>binary64</td><td>Double precision</td><td>2</td><td>53</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>binary128</td><td>Quadruple precision</td><td>2</td><td>113</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>binary256</td><td>Octuple precision</td><td>2</td><td>237</td><td>19</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Aditionally, it&#39;s stated by <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/technical-committees/tc39/">ECMAScript</a> standard that our champion web applications programming language, JavaScript, also follows the IEEE 754 standard. This means JavaScript uses a double precision floating-point decimals storing method so, in a binary representation, decimals are stored in a 64-bits format. All of this information can be simplified with the following formula:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.k3lly.dev/gh/v1/assets/floating-point-formula-example-white.png" alt="Floating-point formula example"></p><p>As a general overview of all the previous information, we state that:</p><ol><li>Involved data types in the example formula are <strong>integers</strong> only.<table><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>significand</td><td>integer</td></tr><tr><td>base</td><td>integer</td></tr><tr><td>exponent</td><td>integer</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li>In every situation described, floating-point numbers mention they&#39;re <strong>an approximation</strong>.</li><li><strong>Precision</strong> is a core concept in floating-point numbers, which mean we are involved in a finite amount of numbers.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="floating-point-precision-in-javascript">Floating-point precision in JavaScript</h2><p>Every involved concept was already mentioned and analyzing the floating-point numbers behavior we should not only understand that there is a limitation, but also that floating-point numbers can generate logic errors on any software product.</p><p>Going back to our main suspect, dynamic typing, any software engineer who wants to become a web technologies expert should know about this behavior since JavaScript is still the dominant programming language in web applications as I type this paragraph. Lets exemplify this behavior in code:</p><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> a = <span class="hljs-number">0.1</span>; <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(a); <span class="hljs-comment">// Prints &quot;0.1&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> a); <span class="hljs-comment">// Prints &quot;number&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> b = <span class="hljs-number">0.2</span>; <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(b); <span class="hljs-comment">// Prints &quot;0.2&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> b); <span class="hljs-comment">// Prints &quot;number&quot;</span> <span class="hljs-comment">// Two normal variables. Nothing suspicious, yet.</span></code><p>As mentioned before, limits are involved. But it doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s impossible to use values outside the range, it just means that we will not have precision on arithmetic operations.</p><hr><h2 id="the-banking-trust-stealer-floating-point-numbers">The banking trust stealer, floating-point numbers</h2><p>There are many Simple, trust. Imagine the scenario where a passive customer finally felt like obtaining a credit card. There are many reasons why customers choose where to store their money, this might not be the most common but they are defenitely part of such a huge decision: trust, reputation and safety.</p>
