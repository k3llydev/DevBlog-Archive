<p>This project is simply a demonstration of my interest in coding and learning new things along with sharing it with others. This might not be the next-generation developer blog, but it surely is a reference for others under my guidance and hopefully, it might help someone else someday.</p><p>Articles can be written as easily as writing <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown syntax</a>. It has most of the features that the Markdown standard has and a couple more thanks to a library I&#39;ve used. For example, here is a brief piece of code of a recursive solution of the Fibonacci sequence:</p><code class="hljs language-javascript">%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-keyword%22%3Efunction%3C/span%3E%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-title%20function_%22%3EFibonacci%3C/span%3E(%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-params%22%3En%3C/span%3E)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-keyword%22%3Eif%3C/span%3E(n%20&lt;=%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-number%22%3E1%3C/span%3E)%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-keyword%22%3Ereturn%3C/span%3E%20n;%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-keyword%22%3Ereturn%3C/span%3E%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-title%20class_%22%3EFibonacci%3C/span%3E(n%20-%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-number%22%3E1%3C/span%3E)%20+%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-title%20class_%22%3EFibonacci%3C/span%3E(n%20-%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-number%22%3E2%3C/span%3E);%0A%7D</code><h2 id="more-features">More features</h2><p>Here are some usual features available with the markdown syntax:</p><ul><li>Tables</li><li>Images</li><li>Links</li></ul><h2 id="automatic-images-integration">Automatic images integration</h2><p>I&#39;ve also given the capability of automatically uploading the images to the configured hosting server so every time I&#39;m using an illustration in any article, it will also be deployed.</p><p><img src="//polymer.png" alt="An illustration"></p><h2 id="should-i-keep-it-going">Should I keep it going?</h2><p>As far as I&#39;ve been writing this you might be able to tell that the capabilities of this application are the same (if not a few more) as Markdown. Now the only remaining task is to bring the articles from my older DevBlog to this one.</p>
