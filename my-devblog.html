<p>This project serves as a demonstration of my passion for coding, continuous learning, and sharing knowledge with others. While it may not be the most advanced developer blog, it is a valuable reference for those I mentor, and I hope it will help others in the future.</p><p>Articles are written using a format similar to <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" title="null" target="_blank">Markdown syntax</a>, with most of the standard Markdown features supported, along with a few extras provided by a custom library. Here&#39;s an example of a simple recursive solution for the Fibonacci sequence:</p><code class="hljs language-javascript">%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-keyword%22%3Efunction%3C/span%3E%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-title%20function_%22%3EFibonacci%3C/span%3E(%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-params%22%3En%3C/span%3E)%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-keyword%22%3Eif%3C/span%3E(n%20&lt;=%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-number%22%3E1%3C/span%3E)%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-keyword%22%3Ereturn%3C/span%3E%20n;%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-keyword%22%3Ereturn%3C/span%3E%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-title%20class_%22%3EFibonacci%3C/span%3E(n%20-%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-number%22%3E1%3C/span%3E)%20+%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-title%20class_%22%3EFibonacci%3C/span%3E(n%20-%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-number%22%3E2%3C/span%3E);%0A%7D</code><h2 id="additional-features">Additional Features</h2><p>Here are some common features supported by the blog:</p><ul><li>Tables</li><li>Images</li><li>Links</li></ul><h2 id="automatic-image-integration">Automatic Image Integration</h2><p>Iâ€™ve also added functionality for automatically uploading images to a configured hosting server. This ensures that when an image is used in any article, it is deployed along with the post.</p><p><img src="/DevBlog-Archive-resources/polymer.png" alt="An illustration"></p><h2 id="whats-next">What&#39;s Next?</h2><p>As you&#39;ve seen, this blog application supports all the functionality of Markdown and even offers a few extra features. The next step is to migrate articles from my previous DevBlog to this new platform.</p>
