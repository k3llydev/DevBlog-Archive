<p>With the technological era, banking services became pillars of today&#39;s humanity not only by providing a new and reliable method of handling money; but also by additional services like loans, insurance, investment services and many others. But unlike other services where customers might evaluate prices, effectiveness times, etc., banking services add <strong>reputation</strong> to the list which is englobed in <strong>trust</strong>.</p><p>We could prioritize objectives based on this and determine that looking after every customer&#39;s trust is crucial for building a reputation. In other words, losing one customer&#39;s trust generates a direct loss of reputation not only because they might consider leaving the institution; but because they have a social circle composed of family, friends and many other potential customers that will most likely receive a negative reference from the customer whose trust was stolen.</p><p>This is what makes this article relevant from <strong>an engineering perspective</strong>. Most topics covered are related to front-end development with computer science and architecture fragments. Diving into technical terms we&#39;ll start with one of the first steps before building any kind of software:</p><h2 id="choosing-a-tech-stack-the-budget-challenge">Choosing a tech stack, The Budget Challenge</h2><p>During the search for the most suitable tech stack, you&#39;ll probably end up evaluating market prices for software development and it&#39;s noticeable that JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. This language has evolved a lot through the years making it extremely cost-efficient which also creates a huge demand for developers.</p><p>To simplify things a little bit let&#39;s place <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a> on the table, a framework that became popular for easing mobile application creation. You code once and deploy on two different operative systems. (Android and iOS) This also reduces costs a lot, but this article is focused on a different topic, coding skills.</p><p>Even if it&#39;s extremely cheap to develop software products with all the examples I&#39;ve mentioned, it&#39;s still potentially dangerous to not consider a budget for highly skilled developers. Even if the programming language is friendly and intuitive for newcomers, as the learning path reduces; complexity increments. This makes it harder to stay in a reliable, safe and clean-code environment.</p><p>Let&#39;s punctuate this issue onto something, <strong>Dynamic Typing</strong>. JavaScript might seem &quot;flexible&quot; when referring to data types and variable declarations, but if a developer isn&#39;t familiar with it any generated code could behave <em>&quot;strangely&quot;</em> with no clue of the origin and not only in previous environments; but also in a productive environment if there&#39;s no proper DevOps testing phase. This is where we get into the main topic of this article, floating-point numbers.</p><hr><h2 id="what-is-a-floating-point-number">What is a &quot;floating-point&quot; number?</h2><p>In computer science, floating-point refers to a method of &quot;<em>storing</em>&quot; real numbers in computer-based arithmetic to support trade-offs between range and precision. Most typical computer systems use the Double Precision <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> standard, but there are some variants:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Common name</th><th>Base</th><th>Significand bits</th><th>Exponent bits</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>binary16</td><td>Half precision</td><td>2</td><td>11</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>binary32</td><td>Single precision</td><td>2</td><td>24</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>binary64</td><td>Double precision</td><td>2</td><td>53</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>binary128</td><td>Quadruple precision</td><td>2</td><td>113</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>binary256</td><td>Octuple precision</td><td>2</td><td>237</td><td>19</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since our main topic involves JavaScript it&#39;s important to mention that as stated by the <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/technical-committees/tc39/">ECMAScript</a> standard, JavaScript also follows the IEEE 754 standard. This means JavaScript uses a double-precision floating-point decimals storing method and this will help us understand later on the <em>&quot;limits&quot;</em> of it. For now, we can simplify the data provided in the previous table with the following formula of how the numbers are treated from a computing perspective:</p><p><img src="https://cdn.k3lly.dev/gh/v1/assets/floating-point-formula-example-white.png" alt="Floating-point formula example"></p><p>As a general overview of all the previous information, we state that:</p><ol><li>Every interpreted number is an <strong>integer</strong>.<table><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>significand</td><td>integer</td></tr><tr><td>base</td><td>integer</td></tr><tr><td>exponent</td><td>integer</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li>Floating-point numbers are <strong>an approximation</strong> only.</li><li>When talking about approximations, <strong>precision</strong> is involved. This creates a finite amount of numbers to work with.</li></ol><hr><h2 id="floating-point-precision-in-javascript">Floating-point precision in JavaScript</h2><p>Every involved concept was already mentioned and analyzing the floating-point numbers behavior we should not only understand that there is a limitation, but also that floating-point numbers can generate logic errors on any software product.</p><p>Going back to our main suspect, dynamic typing, any software engineer who wants to become a web technologies expert should know about this behavior since JavaScript is still the dominant programming language in web applications as I type this paragraph. Lets exemplify this behavior in code:</p><code class="hljs language-javascript">%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-keyword%22%3Econst%3C/span%3E%20a%20=%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-number%22%3E0.1%3C/span%3E;%0A%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-variable%20language_%22%3Econsole%3C/span%3E.%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-title%20function_%22%3Elog%3C/span%3E(a);%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-comment%22%3E//%20Prints%20&quot;0.1&quot;%3C/span%3E%0A%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-variable%20language_%22%3Econsole%3C/span%3E.%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-title%20function_%22%3Elog%3C/span%3E(%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-keyword%22%3Etypeof%3C/span%3E%20a);%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-comment%22%3E//%20Prints%20&quot;number&quot;%3C/span%3E%0A%0A%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-keyword%22%3Econst%3C/span%3E%20b%20=%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-number%22%3E0.2%3C/span%3E;%0A%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-variable%20language_%22%3Econsole%3C/span%3E.%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-title%20function_%22%3Elog%3C/span%3E(b);%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-comment%22%3E//%20Prints%20&quot;0.2&quot;%3C/span%3E%0A%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-variable%20language_%22%3Econsole%3C/span%3E.%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-title%20function_%22%3Elog%3C/span%3E(%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-keyword%22%3Etypeof%3C/span%3E%20b);%20%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-comment%22%3E//%20Prints%20&quot;number&quot;%3C/span%3E%0A%0A%3Cspan%20class=%22hljs-comment%22%3E//%20Two%20normal%20variables.%20Nothing%20suspicious,%20yet.%3C/span%3E</code><p>As mentioned before, limits are involved. But it doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s impossible to use values outside the range, it just means that we will not have precision on arithmetic operations.</p><hr><h2 id="the-banking-trust-stealer-floating-point-numbers">The banking trust stealer, floating-point numbers</h2><p>There are many Simple, trust. Imagine the scenario where a passive customer finally felt like obtaining a credit card. There are many reasons why customers choose where to store their money, this might not be the most common but they are defenitely part of such a huge decision: trust, reputation and safety.</p>
